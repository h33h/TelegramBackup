## üîë Getting Telegram API Credentials

Before using TelegramBackup, you need to obtain your own Telegram API credentials:

1. **Visit the Telegram API Development Tools**:
   - Go to https://my.telegram.org
   - Log in with your Telegram account

2. **Create a New Application**:
   - Click on "API Development tools"
   - Fill out the form with your application details (you can use "TelegramBackup" for app title and short name)
   - Click "Create application"

3. **Get Your API Credentials**:
   - After creating the application, you'll see your **api_id** (a number) and **api_hash** (a string)
   - Keep these values secure - they're associated with your Telegram account

4. **Configure TelegramBackup**:
   - Open the `telegram_backup.py` file in a text editor
   - Locate these lines near the beginning of the file:
     ```python
     api_id = ********
     api_hash = ********************************
     ```
   - Replace them with your actual credentials:
     ```python
     api_id = 12345678  # Replace with your own api_id (numbers only, no quotes)
     api_hash = "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"  # Replace with your own api_hash (in quotes)
     ```
   - Save the file

> **IMPORTANT**: The `api_id` must be an integer without quotes, and the `api_hash` must be a string with quotes.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python telegram_backup.py
    ```

2. **First-Time Login**:
   - Enter your Telegram phone number when prompted (include country code, e.g., +12345678900)
   - You'll receive a code on your Telegram app - enter this code when prompted
   - If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to enter your password

3. **Managing Contacts and Entities**:
   - The script will automatically extract your contacts and save them to a CSV file
   - It will generate a list of all available entities (users, channels, groups) and save it to a CSV file
   - Review the entity list in your console to identify which ones you want to backup

4. **Backup Options**:
   Choose from the menu options:
   - **[E] Process a specific entity**: Backup a single chat, channel, or group
   - **[T] Process all entities**: Backup everything
   - **[X] Close current session**: End the current session securely
   - **[S] Exit**: Exit the program

5. **When processing entities**:
   - You can specify how many messages to retrieve (leave blank for all)
   - Choose whether to download all media files (Y/N)
   - For large chats, consider processing in batches to avoid timeouts

6. **Accessing Your Backup**:
   - Messages are stored in an SQLite database (`.db` file) in the `backups/` directory
   - Each entity has its own subdirectory: `backups/{entity_id}_{entity_name}/`
   - Media files are saved in the `media/` subdirectory within each entity's backup folder
   - You can query the SQLite database directly using any SQLite browser for analysis

## üíæ Database Structure

The SQLite database contains the following main tables:

- **messages**: Stores the core message data including text, media, timestamps, and metadata
- **buttons**: Records message buttons and inline URLs
- **replies**: Tracks reply relationships between messages
- **reactions**: Stores emoji reactions to messages with counts

You can query this database directly using any SQLite browser for advanced analysis or custom exports.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Handling Large Backups

If you're backing up chats with hundreds of thousands of messages:

1. **Start with a smaller batch**: First try backing up a limited number (e.g., 1000) to test
2. **Ensure adequate storage**: Media files can consume significant disk space
3. **Run in a stable environment**: Avoid using USB drives or removable storage for the backup process
4. **Be patient**: Large backups can take considerable time depending on your internet connection

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Syntax Error with API Credentials**:
   - Ensure `api_id` is an integer without quotes
   - Ensure `api_hash` is a string with quotes
   - Double-check that you saved the file after making changes

2. **Connection Errors**:
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check if Telegram is accessible in your region
   - Some networks may block Telegram's API servers

3. **Permission Errors**:
   - Run the script from a location where you have read/write permissions
   - Avoid running from USB drives or network shares if possible

4. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - If you get import errors, verify that all required packages are installed
   - Try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

5. **Session File Issues**:
   - If you get errors related to the `.session` file, delete it and start a new session
   - These files are stored in the same directory as the script

6. **Unicode/Encoding Issues**:
   - If you see encoding problems in CSV files, make sure your terminal supports UTF-8
   - Try opening the CSV files in a modern spreadsheet application instead of a text editor

### Advanced Tips

- **Working with the Database**: The SQLite database can be opened with tools like DB Browser for SQLite if you want to perform custom queries
- **Automating Backups**: Consider setting up a scheduled task to run the script periodically
- **Media File Management**: Large media files are stored separately from the database in the `media/` directory, which you can back up independently

## üìù Technical Details

- **Message Processing**: TelegramBackup iterates through messages of a selected entity, extracts their content and metadata, and stores everything in an SQLite database.
- **Media Handling**: Media files are downloaded to a structured directory and referenced in the database by path and hash.
- **Flood Control**: The script implements flood control management by respecting Telegram API rate limits.
- **Character Encoding**: Special attention is paid to proper UTF-8 encoding to handle all languages and emoji correctly.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Use and Legal Considerations

**TelegramBackup** is intended for personal use, enabling users to backup their own Telegram data. The misuse of this tool, such as unauthorized data extraction from accounts or channels where you do not have permission, is strictly prohibited. Ensure that all data you process with this tool complies with Telegram's terms of service and local data protection laws.
